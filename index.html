const message = `Happy Promise Day, Sanju ❤️

I want to say something from a very honest place today.

I know I have made mistakes.
I know sometimes my words, my reactions, and my overthinking may have hurt you.
And I want you to know — I am not blind to that.

I am not perfect.
Sometimes I let my fears speak louder than my love.
Sometimes my overthinking makes me act in ways that feel toxic to you.

But please understand something deeply —
I never act out of lack of love.
I act out of fear of losing you.

You mean so much to me that even the thought of distance scares me.
And that fear sometimes turns into insecurity, questioning, or overreacting.

That’s not an excuse.
It’s just the truth.

Today, on Promise Day, I don’t want to promise you perfection.
I want to promise you effort.

I promise to:

Work on my overthinking.
Communicate instead of assuming.
Pause before reacting.
Listen to you more than I defend myself.
Grow into someone who feels safe, not heavy.

I don’t want to be someone you tolerate.
I want to be someone you feel peaceful with.

I am willing to change.


I cannot imagine a single day without you in my life.
And that is why I want to become better — not just for us, but for you.

You are not just someone I love.
You are someone I want to build with.

And I promise — I will work every day to become a version of myself that you are proud to stand beside.

Happy Promise Day ❤️
I choose you.
Every day.`;
